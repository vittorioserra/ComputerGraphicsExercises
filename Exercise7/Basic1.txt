The 'Z-fighting' effect occurs when two primitives have similar distances to the camera. Then, the values are really similar or the same in the z-buffer. In the case of the exercise, this happens when the camera is looking directly to the shape localized in the right-bottom corner and the near and far plane are quite separate. We can see at the rendered target at the canonical volume that when we alternate between background or foreground culling, the colors of the shape are not correctly represented.
