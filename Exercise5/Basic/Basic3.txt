The specular section of the lighting term is determined by the reflection of the light in the same direction of the eye. As these vectors start to differ, this term loses importance. For flat and Gouraud shading the phenomena that the reflection vector is not aligned perfectly with the eye vector for the considered points (either at the vertices of the segment in the Gouraud case, or at the midpoint of the segment in the flat case) is clearly noticeable for a small number of segments. This yields the consequence that in case of flat shading, there will be a prominent "reflected light" contribution for an odd number of segments, and a near absence of reflected light contributions for an even number of segments, given that the number of segments is small. The situation is reversed for Gourard shading, as the lighting at the edge of the vectors is averaged over the segment. The root cause resides in the verification of a favorable reflection angle for points near the center of the arced line construct.
This effects tends to vanish as the number of segments increases. With a potentially infinite number of segments, hence an infinitesimally small segment length, the effect would vanish.
The latter explains why this phenomena is not present in case of Phong shading, as the number of segments (or better said surface elements in that particular exercise) is large enough (in the given area) to make this effect not noticeable.
