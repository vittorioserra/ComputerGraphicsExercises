Pros :
-->Easy to implement, as it implies a repetition of the same code. Easy enough to be implemented in assembly-language.
-->Code (machine-code) can be optimized for size.
--> This algorithm can be used on every 2D-canvas, regardless of its size.
Cons :
-->The algorithm is recursive. For each recusion the current "execution-data" has to be saved on the stack. The latter causes an increased memory need, which could be problematic on extremely constrained devices.
-->Because of the recursion, the execution time is elevated.
-->Not all compilers are able to handle recursion, e.g. Fortran-70 did not explicitly allow recursive functions and subroutines, a feature that only got implemented in Fortran-90. The latter could render the implementation of this algorithm impossible.
-->It's not efficient. Pixels are being reevaluated when they have already been. Then, innecessary extra operations computed.
