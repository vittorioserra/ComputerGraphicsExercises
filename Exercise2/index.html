                    <p>
                        From the first exercise you already know the HTML element of type <code>canvas</code>.
                        The canvas on the left contains a red and a green pixel which you should connect with a line during this task.
                        You find the source code of this assignment in the JavaScript file <code>Basic1.js</code>.
                        Your task is to draw a line from the red to the green point using the Bresenham Algorithm by setting the pixels of said canvas in the function <code>bresenham()</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use the helper function <code>setPixelS()</code> provided in <code>Helper.js</code> to set a pixel if needed.
                        Note that this helper function does not only set one pixel but a square of pixels depending on the variable <code>pixelScale</code>.
                        The usage of the function is shown in <code>RenderCanvas1()</code> where start and end point of the line are drawn.
                        You can adjust the size of the pixel square using the slider above.
                        During the editing of function <code>bresenham()</code>, you can use large pixels to better evaluate mistakes and their effects.
                        Once you are finished, you can examine your results for smaller pixels.
                        The connection between the points should look like a straight line then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using the left mouse button you can change the start point of the line.
                        If you hold CTRL you can change the end point.
                        Make sure that your algorithm works for all constellations of start and end point.
                        When thinking about octants, keep in mind that for a HTML canvas, the y axis always goes from top to bottom!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Hint:</b> The comments in the code only give you the roadmap for one octant 
                        (start point x value < end point x value, start point y value < end point y value, 
                        difference in y values < difference in x values). 
                        Try to solve this case first by following the hints in the TODOs.
                        Afterwards, extend your code to make all other octants work as well. 
                        In order to do so, you can change the given structure of the code!
                    </p>

                <task title="Flood Fill" points=3 submitfile="Basic2.js, Basic2.txt">

                    <subtask title="Recursive Flood Fill" points=2>
                        <canvas id="canvas2" width=200 height=200 class="floatRight" data-call="setupFloodFill" data-call-src="./Basic/Basic2.js"></canvas>
                        <p>
                            In this task we want you to implement Flood Fill.
                            Flood Fill is a simple algorithm to fill a 2D object that is defined by a 2D boundary.
                            You find the source code of this assignment in the JavaScript file <code>Basic2.js</code>.
                            Your task is to implement the algorithm in <code>floodFill4()</code> such that it considers the four direct neighbours of a pixel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The algorithm gets a seed point and a color as input.
                            Starting from this pixel position the color of the current pixel is set and the <code>floodFill4()</code> function is recursively called for the surrounding pixels.
                            The recursion should stop if the pixel already has the target color.
                            Note that the boundary has the same color as the target fill color.
                            Use the helper functions <code>setPixel()</code> and <code>getPixel()</code> defined in <code>Helper.js</code> to access a pixel if needed. 
                            Use the return value of <code>getPixel()</code> to handle the canvas border.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Using the left mouse button you can change the seed point to fill one of the rectangles defined in the canvas on the right.
                            The fill color is defined as red.
                        </p>

                <task title="Scanline Algorithm" points=10 submitfile="Advanced.js">
                    <canvas id="canvas3" width=200 height=200 class="floatLeft" data-call="setupScanline" data-call-src="./Advanced/Advanced.js"></canvas>
                    <p>
                        In this task you are asked to implement the Scanline Algorithm used to rasterize a solid polygon.
                        You find the source code of this assignment in the JavaScript file <code>Advanced.js</code>.
                        Have a look at the already existing functions to create an edge table (<code>EdgeTable()</code>) and an active edge table (<code>ActiveEdgeTable()</code>).
                        Note that the entries of the edge table are sorted by <code>y_lower</code>.
                        Use these functions to initialize the Scanline Algorithm and implement the function <code>scanline()</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Scanline Algorithm starts at <code>y = 0</code> and iterates while <code>y < image.height</code>.
                        In every iteration the active edge table is updated.
                        To add a new entry in an active edge table use <code>activeEdgeTable.entries.push(new ActiveEdgeTableEntry(...));</code> and <code>activeEdgeTable.nEntries++;</code>.
                        After updating the active edge table, you have to sort the table according to the <code>x_intersect</code> value.
                        The sorted active edge table allows you to easily set the pixels in the current pixel row.
                        Use <code>setPixel()</code> to set the affected pixels to the color of the polygon (<code>polygon.color</code>).
                    </p>
                    <img class="floatRight" src="images/star.png" width=200>
                    <p>
                        The polygon already defined in <code>Advanced.js</code> defines a five pointed star (see the one on the right). 
                        If your Scanline implementation does not yield a correct image of this star, make sure that you have taken special cases into account and that your algorithm can handle more than two intersections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hints: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Think about what has to be done to horizontal lines like the two which can be found in the outline of the star.</li>
                            <li>Be careful with end and start y values of the lines! </li>
                        </ul>
